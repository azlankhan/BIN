# BIN
B.I.N- Best In Scouting BIN is a scouting system for the FRC 2015 game season, Recycle Rush. 

The aim of the B.I.N system is to be an open-source alternative scouting system for any FRC team. We would
like everybody to be able to contribute to this project to make it better for everybody, so that all teams have
access to the best data so they can make the best decisions and strategies before matches and when selecting teams to
be alliance partners with during the finals. As each version of this system is officially released, there will be a
set of goals listed for the next major version of the system listed at the end of the README document. The goals that 
are listed does not mean that they will be compeleted though. The goals are subject to change at any time. 

This project will be a cross platform application that can run on Windows, Linux, or Mac OSX. This will be acheived 
by programming the B.I.N scouting system in the Javaâ„¢ programming language, this way it is a write once, run anywhere
system.

The goals for version 1.0.0 are as followed:
